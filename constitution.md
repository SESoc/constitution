# SE Soc (Software Engineering Society) Constitution

## Preamble

This document contains the Constitution of the University of 
Waterloo’s Software Engineering Society. The membership is to be 
solely comprised of Undergraduate Software Engineering students at the 
University of Waterloo. This document shall form binding terms of 
reference and shall supersede all previous operating policies and/or 
any previous constitutions.

This Constitution has been very widely based off the Constitution for 
a fellow engineering society, the Civil, Environmental, and Geological 
Engineering Society. This constitution will be ratified only in the 
case in which a referendum to create the Software Engineering Society 
passes with at least 51% of the vote.

## 1.0 Names and Definitions

The following document is the constitution of the Software Engineering 
Society of the University of Waterloo. This document forms the binding 
terms of reference for all the Society’s operations, activities, and 
policies.

### 1.1 Definitions

* The organization shall be known as the Software Engineering Society, SE 
Soc, or the Society.
* Since the engineering students at the University of Waterloo alternate 
between work terms and academic terms every four months, there shall exist 
an A-Society and B-Society to ensure that the society functions year-round;
Therefore, SE Soc is run alternately by two teams of students on 
A-Society and B-Society. Members from the opposite Society may still 
attend events from the other society. 
    * First year Software class will have one term in which they elect 
    class representatives to the society, but they cannot run for 
    executive positions in that term; they can run for executive positions 
    starting the winter of their first year once they are on-stream with 
    their society.
* A-Society Academic Terms shall occur during the fall term during even 
numbered years, the winter term during even numbered years, or the spring 
term during odd numbered years.
* B-Society Academic Terms shall occur during the fall term during odd 
numbered years, the winter term during odd numbered years, or the spring 
term during even numbered years.

## 2.0 Mission statement

SE Soc has a focus on improving the inter- and intra-cohort relationships, 
so every SE student can get the most out of their university experience by 
having many like-minded individuals to work, learn, and bond with.

## 3.0 Objective

The society will serve as the official undergraduate organization of the 
program, and will represent the interests of its members in interactions 
with the program administration, as well as various student organizations 
of other programs, faculties and Universities.

SE Soc will formalize the events and functions that should be run every 
term. Furthermore, having elected officials allows members to hold people 
accountable for those events and functions.

## 4.0 Organization of society

### 4.1 General membership

Membership in the Society will be restricted to those full time 
undergraduate students in the Software Engineering program at the 
University of Waterloo. Members of the society shall be entitled to voting 
rights in elections and at All Class General Meetings (ACGM), and shall be 
eligible to run for office (See Article 6 ‘Elections’ and Article 5 
‘Meetings’).

There shall be two (2) types of Members:

1. A-Society
2. B-Society

Executives will have an honorary membership in the alternate society from 
which they originated. Honorary membership allows the attending of SE Soc 
events and Council meetings, but not the rights for voting in Executive or 
class elections of the alternate society.

### 4.3 General Council

The General council consists of the executive council listed above as well 
as two social reps, three in the case of a 1A or 1B class. The social reps 
will be elected as outlined in 6.2; their terms will last one academic 
term, unless removed for any reason as listed under 7.0.

## 5.0 Meetings

### 5.1 General council meetings

General Council Meetings will be held every three weeks, starting with the 
week immediately after class elections are held in seminar classes. The 
final meeting will be held during the second-last week of classes. Any 
meetings held during finals or between terms would be optional and 
therefore there would be no penalty for missing them.

Every General Council Meeting will have an agenda released before the 
start which outlines the topics to be discussed in that meeting. Every 
meeting, except the first of the term, starts with the approval of the 
minutes from the last meeting. Execs are expected to give an update on 
what they’ve done since the last meeting. Following the exec updates, any 
EngSoc, MathSoc, WEEF or MEF reps that want to share things with SE will 
have the floor. Following all updates the first item of the agenda will be 
started.

The last meeting of the term is to be held in a licensed establishment or 
a private residence, and consumption of alcohol is permitted for all 
members of the society who are of legal drinking age.

#### 5.1.1 Speaker

There will be a speaker whose job it is to keep the General Council 
Meetings going and to bring up new agenda items as the meeting goes on. It 
will also be their job to accept agenda items that are emailed to them.

#### 5.1.2 Secretary

The Secretary’s job will be to take the meeting notes for every General 
Council Meeting, as well as to ensure the meeting notes are available to 
the entire council. 

### 5.2 Executive council meetings

Executive Council meetings are held between each term and involve the 
executives from both streams. In-person attendance is not mandatory due to 
logistical difficulties, but it is encouraged. It is up to the incoming 
society executives to call the meeting, and to plan a time and place. The 
outgoing executives are expected to create an agenda for the meeting, 
deciding what should be mentioned and discussed from their outgoing term.

## 6.0 Elections

### 6.1 Executive elections

Elections will be held in the middle of every winter term. The position 
will be held by the person for two consecutive years starting the co-op 
term immediately following the election. This means the executive will 
have 3 academic terms as an exec.

In order to run for any elected position, the student must currently be 
enrolled in the Software Engineering program at the University of 
Waterloo. In order to run for the position of President, said student must 
have been in the SE program for strictly greater than 1 calendar year.

All candidates for executive positions will have a spending limit of $25 
for their campaigns. All money for campaigns will not be reimbursed by the 
society.

#### 6.1.1 Special elections

In the case an executive is no longer able to hold their executive 
position, a special election will be held. The other case in which a 
special election is permitted is if the winter election period was missed 
and no executives have been elected. The special election will be held 
during the current academic term if there is more than 1 month remaining; 
otherwise, it will be run at the beginning of the following academic term.

### 6.2 Class rep elections

Social rep elections will be held in the class seminar during the first 
week of classes. Each class will have a maximum of two class 
representatives. For 1A and 1B classes, there is an exception: they will 
be allowed 3 Social reps.

## 7.0 Impeachment

### 7.1 Automatic Impeachment

An elected official who leaves the Software Engineering program will be 
removed from their role. Leaving the program includes, but is not limited 
to: switching to another program, graduating, or taking an indefinite 
leave of absence from the University. 

### 7.2 Automatic motions for impeachment

An automatic motion for impeachment will be included for any elected 
official for doing any of the following:

* Missing 3 General Council meetings that required the representative’s 
attendance within a single academic term
* Missing 2 consecutive meetings without explanation and advanced warning

### 7.3 Other Motions for Impeachment

Any elected official may bring up a motion to impeach another elected 
official. The motion should describe what the person has done that 
infringes on the rules outlined in this constitution or otherwise shitty 
things.

## 8.0 Start of Society

### 8.1 Initial temporary execs

There will be a group of initial temporary execs made up of the students 
who helped found the society in order to transition the society into its 
first elections, and to be a point of contact from the end of referendum 
until the election of executives as outlined in section 6.1.

The temporary execs will be as follows:

A-Soc: 
* President: Spencer Dobrik (2020)
* VP-Events: Katherine Lu (2020)
* VP-Communication: Yingning Gui (2022)
* VP-Finance: Ayush Kapur (2022)

B-Soc:
* President: Bilal Akhtar (2019)
* VP-Events: Roxane Fruytier (2021)
* VP-Communication: Jenny Wills (2021)


There will be no temporary VP-Finance, and that role will fall under the 
President (since many of its roles should not be active yet).

8.0 Amending the Constitution

The constitution may be amended by a motion at a general meeting , and may be changed via a two thirds majority so long as quorum (50% of available members) is met. That amendment will be enacted starting the meeting it is approved, but must be ratified by the off-stream General Council the following term to be fully introduced into the constitution. If the amendment is not ratified by both councils within 2 terms, the constitution will be reverted to its prior form.
